		  *** USING LOOS WITH YOUR CODE ***

This directory is intended to be a template for getting you started
with using LOOS with either SCons or Make.  The bundled program,
'center-pdb' is the LOOS way of saying "hello world!"  Simply copy
this directory and start adding your own code, building it with either
SCons (recommended) or make.  Note that the sample SCons and make
files assume that LOOS is already installed somewhere.

Alternatively, see the new "Packages/User" directory for tool
templates that reside within the LOOS directory and can be build
alongside LOOS.

* Using SCons

Be sure you have sourced the LOOS setup script appropriate to your
shell.  Now, edit the SConscript file and add the name of your tool to
the apps list.  For example, if your tool is named 'solve-phases.cpp',
then you will change the line,

apps = 'center-pdb'

to,

apps = 'center-pdb solve-phases'


Now run "scons" in that directory.

For more information about building your own code with LOOS, refer to
the LOOS Doxygen documentation...
