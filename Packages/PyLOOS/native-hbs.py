"""     
    native-hbs.py : Find the hydrogen bonds present in some reference
    selection, then output their average occupancy over a trajectory 
    (and optionally a timeseries of those occupancies and a PDB of 
    the atoms in the HBs).

    The expected use-case is the commonly asked question, 'does this Hydrogen
    bonded structure persist in the simulation?' The expectation is that the
    user would have some molecular model (such as a PDB) where the  H-bonded
    structure is present (say, a Watson-Crick duplex) and a  trajectory of that
    molecule which may no longer retain the structure.

    You may optionally specify files to get not just the average HB occupancy in
    your selection, but also the per-frame occupancy of each hydrogen bond in
    the selection in an output file. You can also optionally provide an  outfile
    name for a PDB of the hydrogen bonded atoms the script finds. This makes for
    easy visualisation: load that file and your ref up in a  visualizer, then
    view the model in sticks (or something smaller) and the H-bonded atoms as
    spheres (or something bigger). Alternatively, you could have your structure
    viewer draw HB for one 'molecule' then the other and see whether the script
    found the ones you were hoping it would

    Example commandline with no optional arguments: 
    native-hbs.py -m xtal_molA.pdb -x traj_molA.dcd

    This will print the following values separated by spaces to stdout:
    Number_frames Number_HBs Average_HBs

    Example commandline with all the optional arguments: native-hbs.py \
    -m xtal_mol_A.pdb -x traj_mol_A.dcd -n native_hbs_found_A.pdb \
    -o native_hbs_timeseries_A.dat -b 4 -a 20 \
    -s '(resid < 4 || resid > 8) &&!backbone'

    Note that with all the options present the three values above are still
    written to standard out, but the outfile specified by -o will contain the
    occupancy of each found HB by frame so they can be readily recalculated from
    those files if you chose not to redirect the output.

    Note also that the default selection string is 'all', which may cause the
    program to crash and will produce confusing and unuseful output if your
    model system has many waters present. For a PDB or NMR structure with no
    ordered waters this is no issue but a model system containing a full solvent
    box (such as a restart from a trajectory) or ordered waters will run into
    this issue.  The right way to handle this is to use the -s flag and select
    the part  of the model that is of interest.
