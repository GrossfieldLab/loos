    all_stacking.py tracks the stacking of a set of cylindrical objects. In
    principle, these could be anything, but the program is designed to work
    with nucleic acid bases, where it will naturally track the average
    stacking score for each base in the selection with all others.

    Usage: all_stacking.py [OPTIONS] system_file selection_string outfile traj1 [traj2 ...]
        -- system_file is a PDB, PSF, prmtop, etc
        -- selection_string identifies the atoms to be analyzed. They will be
           split by residue number to identify the individual sets to be
           evaluated.
        -- outfile will be a numpy-style text-file containing the results. It
           will be a square matrix (num_res x num_res, where num_res is the
           number of residues in the selection)
        -- traj1 is a trajectory file, eg DCD, xtc. Its contents must precisely
           match the system file. Optionally, you can include more than 1
           trajectory file


    Options
        --skip: # of residues to exclude from the front of each trajectory
        --stride: how to step through the trajectory (eg --stride 10 will read
              every 10th frame)
        --fullhelp: print this message
        --base_carbons: apply an additional selection string to the one given
            on the command line, which will exclude the backbone and only
            include carbons atoms. This is for convenience only, since you
            could do this yourself with the command line selection. We exclude
            hydrogens because for RNA the base hydrogens are generally coplanar
            with the carbons, and we exclude the nitrogens because in some
            bases they're out of the plane.
        --normfile: attempt to normalize the stacking relative to that present
            for A-form RNA helices.

        An example input for the --normfile option is stack_vals.json, found
        in the share/ directory of the LOOS distribution, and installed in
        $CONDA_PREFIX/share/loos/stack_vals.json if you installed LOOS into
        a conda environment. These values were determined from a structure  built as a perfect A-form RNA helix using NAB from AmberTools. The file
        is basically a dictionary with 2 dash-separated residue names as the key and the stacking value as the value.
