Each subdirectory here contains a separate example membrane system. In order
of increasing complexity, they are:

popc: a POPC bilayer in water
pope-popg: a mixture of 2 lipids in water
rhodopsin: a protein embedded in lipids
rhod-water: a protein without a membrane (because sometimes the Optimal 
           membrane is none at all)

We highly suggest that you base your own config files on one of these
files, as that will generally be simpler than composing a config file from
scratch. 

Note: the config files almost certainly will _not_ run on your system
unchanged, because they contain absolute pathnames.  In each directory, there
is a file ending with the extension ".cfg" -- edit these files so that the
various paths match where you installed OMG, the lipid libraries, and NAMD.
You'll need to change the lines labelled "parameters", "topology", "segment",
and "water", and depending on where you installed namd and psfgen you may
need to add lines specifying their location (see the OMG manual for the syntax).

Once you've done that, you can test your OMG install by running the script 
'run_examples' in this directory.
