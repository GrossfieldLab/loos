# USAGE:   ./conda_build.sh -e loos -j 8 -i
#          This will create a conda env called loos (or install in it if it
#          exists). It will run scons with 8 jobs, and will do an install into
#          the conda env when it's done.
#          ./conda_build -h
#          will show all options.
